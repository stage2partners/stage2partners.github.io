					<h2>OUR GUIDING PHILOSOPHY</h2>
					<p>Stage 2 Partners was established to facilitate the development of early stage companies and get them to the next level in their business. In some cases this means developing a go-to market strategy; in others it means developing distribution channels; and in others it means assisting my clients to raise capital.  At Stage 2 Partners, we drive results through customized services and cross-functional expertise in strategic planning, marketing, business development, revenue generation, and operational controls. Internal capabilities and leadership skills are honed at every level. We accelerate our clients' success by identifying key issues to provide cost-effective, value-added services and solutions.</p>

								<p>Steve has been a valued advisor during the critical stages of our company's development. We brought Steve in at a time that we were experiencing a growth spurt. As our business grew, Steve worked closely with us to establish solid business processes to help us scale our operations. He helped us develop a solid revenue model, worked with us to have a deeper understanding of financial expectations and advised us on best business practices for growing the revenue pipeline. Steve has great patience for the challenges that early stage companies face, as well as a creative and out-of the-box approach about how to advance a company to a prosperous future.</p>

								<p>We worked with Stage 2 Partners to create an event in Ottawa that would bring international investors to meet Canadian startups. Axis Ottawa was our first effort in the Canadian market and we had investors and business partners from more than 15 countries meet with early stage startups in 2015 and 2016.  This was the first time that an international platform for Canadian startups was created in Ottawa and the response from the startup community and international investors was very positive. Stage 2 worked to identify exciting startups with meaningful technologies and worked closely with Axis Innovation to secure top international partners such as Deloitte, Thalys as well as local players from industry, government and the media. Would be happy to work with Steve and the team in the future.</p>

								<p>I have known Steve for over 20 years. In the mid '90s I hired Steve as a business consultant for Discovery Recovery, a medical software company. We subsequently, over the next 6 years, founded and ran Softcare, a disease management company and Net Talk, an Internet venture. In 2010 I founded Nuraleve, an 8 engineer, 2 physician, University of Ottawa medical device spinoff. I called on Steve to help us establish a business unit in the organization. We went through a thorough exercise that defined our revenue model and pricing structure. Steve also helped us identify new markets outside of Canada and led the re-branding process as we evolved as a company. He is a trusted adviser and has been integral part of our success.</p>

								<p>As our business has grown, I found myself in new territory, and preferred not to learn every lesson the hard way. The solution to that was Stage 2 Partners, who were recommended to me by a mutual contact. They bring an enormous wealth of experience with all types of businesses at all stages, but with a particular focus on those, like mine, who have graduated from start-up. I have worked with consultants before, but this was the first time where I really felt I was working with someone who truly understands and grasps all parts of a business: management, process, financial, strategy, marketing and sales. Even after 18 months, Steve continues to provide valuable insight and perspective. I highly recommend Stage 2 for any business looking for guidance.</p>

								<p>I was at a strategic crossroads regarding the future direction of my company Renaissance. I had a pretty clear idea of where I wanted to go, but needed help organizing my thoughts and preparing a solid business plan. Steve was instrumental in guiding the strategic process. He forced me to make the tough decisions and to be realistic about what it would take to achieve my goals. What was really great was that we got right to the meat of the issues on day-one and and when we were done with the process, I had a tangible business plan that helped to me take my company to where it is today.</p>

								<p>Even before we signed with Stage 2 as a distributor, Steve stepped in and worked closely with us to reshape our business model and product offering. He was an excellent strategic advisor at a critical time in the development of the company and played a key role in helping us rethink our go to market strategy. His knowledge of selling into the healthcare space was instrumental in this development. Steve worked hard to set up our first open label clinical trial in the US and has played an important role in our rebranding process.</p>
